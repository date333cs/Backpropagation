# Backpropagation

- bpnn.py is a short code (great) written by Neil Schemenauer.
-- http://arctrix.com/nas/, http://arctrix.com/nas/python/bpnn.py

- But there are bugs in the code, so I fixed them (named bpnn_ad.py).
- However for the XOR problem, its performace seems not better than the original.
- I don't know why. I am sure what I fixed. I welcome comments.
