# Backpropagation

- bpnn.py is a short code (great) written by Neil Schemenauer.
-- http://arctrix.com/nas/, http://arctrix.com/nas/python/bpnn.py

- But there seems to be bugs in the code, so I fixed it (named bpnn_ad.py).
- However its performace is not better than the original.
- I don't know why. I am sure what I fixed.
