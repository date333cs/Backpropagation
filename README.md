# Backpropagation

Here we try to reproduce figures presented in the great papers.

- Fig.1 of Learning representations by back-propagating errors (Rumelhart et al, Nature, vol.323, pp.533-536, 1986) 
- Neural networks and the bias/variance dilemma (Geman et al, Neural Computation, vol.4, pp.1-58. 1992)
