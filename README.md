# Backpropagation

Here we try to reproduce figures presented in the great papers.

## Learning representations by back-propagating errors (Rumelhart et al., Nature, vol.323, pp.533-536, 1986) 
- Figure 1 (XOR problem)

## Neural networks and the bias/variance dilemma (Geman et al., Neural Computation, vol.4, pp.1-58. 1992)
- Figure 3 (sinusoid-within-rectangle problem, SWR)
- Figure 4 (k-nearest-neighbor regression, k=1,..,10, SWR)
- Figure 5 (1 and 2-nearest-neighbor regression, SWR)
- Figure 6 (average of 100 5-nearest-neighbor machines, SWR)
- Figure 7 (Bias and variance of 1 and 10-nearest-neighbor estimators, SWR)
- Figure 8 (Bias and variance of feedforward neural networks, #(hidden units)=1,...,15, SWR)
- Figure 9 (two examples of the output of feedforward neural networks, #(hidden units)=5, SWR)
